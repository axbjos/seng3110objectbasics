## Object Oriented & JUnit 4 Basics

### Sample Code for the Coursera Related Labs

This repository contains the code necessary to complete Lab 3

### Demo.java File

This is the source Java class that is to be unit tested.

It is a simple program with two static methods:

- A main method that includes code that prompts the user for the lengths of three sides.  

- A method named "isTriangle" that computes if the lengths of the sides create a triangle.  The method returns a simple boolean true or false.

Compile this code using the following:

``` java Demo.java ```

Then run with:

``` java Demo ```

Try it with the following input:

```  Enter side 1:
1
Enter side 2:
1
Enter side 3:
1
This is a triangle. ```
